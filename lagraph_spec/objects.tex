\chapter{Objects}
\label{Chp:Objects}

The LAGraph library depends on a number of objects to represent 
graphs, vectors, and other types associated with graph algorithms in LAGraph.
Other objects are not directly associated with the input and output variables, 
but instead modify the behavior of the LAGraph functions.  These are 
related to the descriptors in the GraphBLAS.

In this chapter, we need to describe all of the objects a user of LAGraph
needs to understand.  This is also where we describe the types of LAGraph
objects and any constraints on those types.
