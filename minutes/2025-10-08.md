    * agenda:

        - assign one or more algorithms or utilities to everyone for review
            (see below)

        - new GraphBLAS features (review GxB API):

            - printing of user-defined types 

            - GPU: getting close to production for a few internal kernels

            - C<C> = ... some uses require M=C to be copied, then do C<M>=...
                kernels that can be done without the copy, where C is aliased
                with M or A:

                (1) C<C,struct> = scalar, in SSGrB for a long time;
                        C becomes iso-valued.

                (2) C<C,struct> += A, now takes O(nnz(A)*log(n)) time, at most.
                        C can have zombies.  No new entries added to C and
                        no entries deleted.  To appear in v10.2.0.

            - possible new features, to exploit C==M and/or C==A aliasing:

                These 2 kernels are in FalkorDB which I don't have a special
                case:

                    (3) C<!M,struct,replace> = C, which I think only does
                        deletions; my current assign kernels might be OK.
                        Always followed by a GrB_wait.

                    (4) C<M,struct>=M, which only does additions in FalkorDB
                        but could do updates to existing entries in C in
                        general.  my current assign kernels might be OK.
                        Always followed by a GrB_wait.

                other possible aliases to exploit:

                    (5) C<C,struct> = A, can lead to updates or deletions

                    (6) C<A,struct> += A, possibly with replace

                    (7) C<!M, struct> += M, possibly with replace

                Are these cases important to LAGraph, python-graphblas,
                FalkorDB, etc?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    consider these methods for src.  Minor revisions needed in some of them,
    including API revisions:

        LAGr_BreadthFirstSearch_Extended.c: uses LG_:
            LG_BreadthFirstSearch_SSGrB_Extended.c
            LG_BreadthFirstSearch_vanilla_Extended.c
        LAGr_PeerPressureClustering.c
        LAGraph_AllKCore.c: need both basic & adv methods; this is mixed
        LAGraph_AllKTruss.c
        LAGraph_HITS.c
        LAGraph_Hdip_Fiedler.c: needs lots of polish
        LAGraph_KCore.c: need both basic & adv
        LAGraph_KTruss.c
        LAGraph_MaximalIndependentSet.c: rename LAGr_, need a basic method
        LAGraph_SquareClustering.c
        LAGraph_VertexCentrality_Triangle.c
        LAGraph_coloring_MIS.c
        LAGraph_coloring_independent_set.c
        LAGraph_lcc.c
        LAGraph_cdlp.c: use Container methods

    abandon the need for vanilla methods and just return GrB_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
    if not using SuiteSparse/GraphBLAS.h.

        LAGr_EdgeBetweennessCentrality.c
        LAGr_MarkovClustering.c (but see latest issue posted)
        LAGr_Modularity.c
        LAGr_PartitionQuality.c
        LAGr_SwapEdges.c
        LAGraph_SwapEdges.c
        LAGraph_CFL_reachability.c
        LAGraph_EstimateDiameter.c
        LAGraph_ExactDiameter.c
        LAGraph_FastGraphletTransform.c
        LAGraph_KCoreDecompose.c
        LAGraph_MultiSourceBFS.c
        LAGraph_RegularPathQuery.c
        LAGraph_RichClubCoefficient.c
        LAGraph_scc.c
        LG_CC_FastSV5.c
        LG_CC_FastSV7_FA.c

    Algorithms need work:

        LAGr_MaxFlow.c (need to provide output R matrix?  And flow_matrix is
                expensive to compute; revise)
        LAGraph_argminmax.c
        LAGraph_msf.c
        LAGraph_BF_*.c: need just one variant

    need new LAGraph_Graph enums:

        LAGraph_MaximalMatching.c: need LAGraph_Graph incidence matrix
        LAGraph_Coarsen_Matching.c: need LAGraph_Graph incidence matrix,
            and vanilla method
        LAGr_MaximumMatching.c:  need to switch to Container methods;
            need LAGraph_Graph bipartite graph, and vanilla method
        LAGraph_cc_lacc.c: unsure

    do not consider:

        LAGr_PageRankGX.c: for LDBC benchmarks only
        LAGr_TriangleCount_GPU.c: for testing draft GPU kernels only
        LAGraph_dnn.c: for an IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge only
        LAGraph_HelloWorld.c: will always be experimental
        LAGraph_cdlp_withsort.c: OK, but slow, see LAGraph_cdlp instead
