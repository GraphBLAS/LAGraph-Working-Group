## Minutes

**Minutes** by Scott McMillan (and Tim M?)

### Last meeting minutes reviewed.

### Revisited ownership of output

We discussed the existing idiom where the methods take a pointer to `GrB_Vector` (for example) and the algorithm allocates the space and type by calling something like `GrB_Vector_new`.  If the vector was already allocated the reference to that other data will be lost.

We discussed an alternative where the `GrB_Vector` is set to `NULL` before calling the algorithm.  This approach was ultimately rejected.  As conflicting with other approaches.

We discussed an alternative where the 'GrB_Vector` is allocated outside of the algorithm and passed in.  Allocation would be performed according to the documentation of the algorithm and the vector would be passed by value (not pointer).  This approach is currently used by `IN/OUT` parameters.  It will also likely be used by many other expert mode algorithms (especially those focusing on high-performance).


### Shortest paths revisited

The single-source, single-desintation version has been removed from consideration for the "easy" mode.  It is unknown whether such a version is reasonable given the optimization 'nature' of the SSSP algorithm

The multi-source version (analogous to a batch mode BC algorithm) was also removed from consideration for the "easy" mode.

The only two versions that currently survive are:

General signature `GrB_Info LAGraph_ShortestPath_[...]`, where `[...]` might be:

* `SingleSource` (see the signature in [`LAGraph.h`](../LAGraph.h))
* `AllPairs`: expensive but it's a well-known linear algebra-based algorithm (Floydâ€“Warshall)

### Next up (again)

Reviewing the GAP / LDBC Graphalytics algorithms.
