## Minutes

Short discussion about the roperties of `LAGraph_Graph`:
* Multigraphs with edge properties are tricky.
  * They can be represented with an incidence matrix.
  * However, they might be too advanced for easy mode.
* Directed/undirected
* Bipartite graph (they are rarely directed but it's not impossible)

Conclusion: we need a few algorithms in LAGraph, then we can answer this. We should postpone this discussion.

## Algorithms

### k-truss

* one k-truss
* all k-trusses
* next k-truss (expert mode)
