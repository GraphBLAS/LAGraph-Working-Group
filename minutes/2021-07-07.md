## Minutes

Scott and Tim reviewed experimental code that was moved to "old" pending removal.  All of it will be deleted.  Next step for Scott is to make sure all of the experimental/test/ programs run and check answers from master branch (and thereby create an initial regression test or two for each).

The bulk of the meeting was spent discussing the roles of LAGraph and GraphBLAS Spec when it comes to determining the responsibilities of something like LAGraph_BinRead/Write versus GrB_Matrix_import/export.

Erik Welch asserts that GrB_Matrix_import/export should only be concerned with the "local"/platform in-memory representations of the three arrays that these methods use.

LAGraph's binary formats should be concerned with cross platform portability for now which includes more specifications

Pseudocode for illustrating the relationship between these:

```
LAGraph_BinWrite(GrB_Matrix A, GrB_Type A_type, char const header[256], bool compress_flag, FILE *f):
   // get the size of the GrB arrays (in elements)
   GrB_Index n_indptr, n_indices, n_values;
   GrB_Matrix_exportSize(&n_indptr, &n_indices, &n_values, GrB_CSR_FORMAT, A);
   
   // Allocate enough storage to hold the arrays and export data
   GrB_Index *indptr, *indices;
   <A_type>  *values;                // details omitted about how to manage types
   indptr  = malloc( n_indptr*sizeof(GrB_Index));
   indices = malloc(n_indices*sizeof(GrB_Index));
   values  = mallocValues(n_values, A_type);
   GrB_Matrix_export(indptr, indices, values, GrB_CSR_FORMAT
   
   // Output information (note: network order as big-endian is a defacto standard, but most x86 systems are not) 
   n = A.nrows()
   m = A.ncols()
   nnz = A.nvals()
   
   assert(n+1 == n_indptr)
   assert(nnz == n_indices)
   assert(nnz == n_values)
   
   // assume binwrite has the logic of converting endianness when necessary
   asciiwrite(header, 256);
   binwrite_uint64(get_type_enum(A_type));
   binwrite_uint64(get_type_size(A_type));
   binwrite_uint64(get_format_enum(GrB_CSR_FORMAT));
   binwrite_uint64(n);
   binwrite_uint64(m);
   binwrite_uint64_array(indptr,  n_indptr);
   binwrite_uint64_array(indices, n_indices);
   binwrite_byte_array(values, n_values, sizeof(A_type));  // not sure what to do here.
```
