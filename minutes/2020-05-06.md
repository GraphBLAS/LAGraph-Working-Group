## Agenda and Minutes

**Agenda** by ???

**Minutes** by Scott Kolodziej

- [X] API namespace and function signature discussion
    > No namespaces in C, so what prefix should we use for function signatures? LAGraph_, LAG_, LAGr_, LG_?
    > Change name of library entirely (LAGraph -> GraphPACK?)
- [X] More API discussion - Betweenness Centrality is a good case study
    > Do we need bc and bc_batch? bc is currently a bc_batch with a single source node.
    > What about an "easy mode" bc? That would require some approximation. Run batches of size k and check for convergence?
    > Probably need layers of some sort: High-level "easy," lower-level "expert," and utilities.
- [X] Some algorithms need more info: Iterate over row or column? Push or pull in BFS?
    > Need that info from GraphBLAS. But how?
