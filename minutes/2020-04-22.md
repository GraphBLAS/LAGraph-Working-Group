## Agenda and Minutes

- [ ] What is LAGraph?
    * Is it a lowish-level graph library that many interfaces and/or libraries will be built on?
        - Implementers become our primary stakeholders
        - Performance over user-friendliness. API can afford to be a little messy, since we will still have some sort of wrapper between us and a user.
    * **Is it a highish-level graph library that users will be able to use as a drop-in graph library?**
        - **C/C++ users become our primary stakeholders**
        - **User-friendliness is key. Users will not tolerate clunky/messy APIs.**
        > Of course we want both user-friendliness and performance. But, when in conflict, our focus is on user-friendliness of the C API.
- [ ] LAGraph Levels Idea
    * Level 0 is GraphBLAS
    * Level 1 are LAGraph functions that (almost?) exclusively call GraphBLAS
        - Lots of input, lots of output. Ex: Connected components. Return number, vertex labels, etc.
    * Level 2 are LAGraph functions that (almost?) exclusively call LAGraph
        - Very concise input (few arguments), very concise output.
