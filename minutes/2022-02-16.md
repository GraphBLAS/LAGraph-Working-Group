    * user guide: see also Gabor's Feb 2021 draft
        ( https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph-Docs ).
        need discussion on how experimental gets promoted to src.

    * test, document, polish all src & experimental: algorithms, utilities,
        and tests.

    * see new cached propertes: G->emin, G->emax, for SSSP

    * CC is not Basic: needs G->structure_is_symmetric

    * add Basic SSSP to pick Delta by itself?
        No. Do the Basic method later (not v1.0)

    * naming convention needed to distinguish Basic vs Advanced methods

        LAGraph_BreadthFirstSearch
        LAGraph_BreadthFirstSearch_...
        LAGraph_VertexCentrality_Betweenness
        LAGraph_VertexCentrality_Betweenness__Stuff (two underscores
            denotes Advanced)?

not discussed:

    * remove LAGraph_VertexCentrality? 

    * CC: G->A is temporarily modified (unpacked then repacked), returned
        the same as on input.  
        Need new GxB methods in GraphBLAS for CC, ideally for v1.0 of LAGraph:
        GxB_select with GxB_RankUnaryOp, and GxB_extract with GrB_Vectors as
        inputs instead of (GrB_Index *) arrays.
        Or do we use CC as-is and Tim adds the GxB methods later?
