- [ ] How do we handle errors? Do we include an error flag as an argument to a function or as returned value? We are currently returning a GrB_info value. Do we need an LAgraph_info? Does integration with Python favor one approach over the other?
- [ ] Is there an LAGraph context? Or do we just used the GraphBLAS context? Do we pass the context to each individual library routine (sort of like what we do when we call MPI routines)?
- [ ] What rules do we use to generate a function name from the mathematical operation?
- [ ] Do we need a nonpoloymorphic interface as we have for the GraphBLAS?
