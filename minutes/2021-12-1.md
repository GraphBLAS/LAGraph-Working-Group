    * entire user guide needs to be written.
        need discussion on how experimental gets promoted to src.

    * test, document, polish all src & experimental: algorithms, utilities,
        and tests.
        as of Nov 30: testing is at 94.7%.  Only untested functions are
        4 experimental/algoritms: lcc, cdlp, scc, and msf.

    * unify error return values as much as possible, now that v2.0 C API
        has assigned enum values to GrB_Info.  Suggest we use GrB_Info
        values, as ints, as much as possible.  Briefly discussed.

    * brutal memory testing: in progress.  grep for brutal in the latest
        Nov 30 version.

    * need new GxB methods in GraphBLAS for CC, ideally for v1.0 of LAGraph:
        GxB_select with GxB_RankUnaryOp, and GxB_extract with GrB_Vectors as
        inputs instead of (GrB_Index *) arrays.

    * for passing a pointer to a user-owned array (see LG_CC_Boruvka):

            uintptr_t? (instead of uint64_t cast)
            it's in C99 and C++03
            Michel Pelletier to Everyone (2:38 PM)
            "The following type designates an unsigned integer type with the
            property that any valid pointer to void can be converted to this
            type, then converted back to a pointer to void, and the result will
            compare equal to the original pointer: uintptr_t"
