## Agenda and Minutes

**Agenda** by ???

**Minutes** by Scott Kolodziej

- [X] API and Algorithms Discussion
    > Fundamental issue emerging: What information do we provide to algorithms? What information is needed?
    > Are properties discoverable? Some are (symmetry), others are not (symmetric matrix with lower triangular portion provided)
    > "Easy button" - we want to have to provide only minimal information (few arguments). "Expert mode" - we may have a lot of information transfer (lots of arguments).
- [X] Easy vs Expert Modes
    > It's becoming increasingly apparent that there is a VAST gulf of separation between the easy mode and expert mode. Expert mode requires a lot of information, especially if performance is important. Easy mode should remain user-friendly, and we should not expect the user to have to understand or specify lots of information.
    > How do we reconcile this?
