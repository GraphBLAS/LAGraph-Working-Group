    topics:
    * add more algorithms
    * document how algorithms are to be added
    * Network X <---> LAGraph
    * look at cuGraph

    * better kernels in GraphBLAS (GxB):
        - 'aggregator' monoids, (community detection needs mode)

            c = A*x
            monoid: "mode" (not a monoid)
            mult:   second(aij,x) = x

        - GrB_Vector-based method for GxB_select of a matrix
            (need by scc, and more)

            select op:
                depends on parent, dense vector

                keep a(i,j) if parent(i) == parent(j)

        - workvector format for GrB_Vector

        - JIT
        - CUDA, SYCL, ...

    * add to SuiteSparse (cmake mods)

    * Intel DevCloud -- benchmark GAP: Saphire Rapids
