## Minutes

### Discussion on submatrices

Scott's and Tim D's suggestion to Gabor's [issue](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph/issues/83): it's probably better to use extract submatrix and also extract the matrix representing the outgoing edges from it.

### Discussion on direction optimization

For LAGraph and any GraphBLAS library, it's important to know whether the underlying implementation stores the matrix by-row, by-column or both.
Then, it could perform direction optimization, i.e., push/pull, similar to the idea in [GraphBLAST](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01407.pdf).

The API should follow an OpenGL-like extension mechanism, which allows libraries like LAGraph to query for "vendor-specific" extensions (which may later make their way into the standard API).
