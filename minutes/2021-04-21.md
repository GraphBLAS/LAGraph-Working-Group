## Minutes

Tim Davis: status report on the upcoming SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, v5.

Scott: We need a test framework. The current tests are basically demos.
Based on web search, Googletest is the recommended framework but it needs a C++ compiler.
The test framework should not only check the results but also test assertions.

Scott: We need documentation. [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is used by Scott for another project, it uses reStructuredText.

Scott, Gabor: We'll create a build matrix in the GitHub Actions configuration for Mac/Linux and SuiteSparse:GrahpBLAS v4, v5, and future versions.

Documentation:
* [Executable book project](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/)
* [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org/)

We need to document both the API and how the algorithms work internally.
