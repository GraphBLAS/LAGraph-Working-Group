## Minutes

### Discussion on connected components

The current connected components algorithm uses code outside of GraphBLAS to sample the graph. It extracts rows and takes e.g. 4 elements from the beginning and the end of the row.

Currently, the select operation (both GxB and the upcoming GrB) are only aware of the 'absolute' index of the elements row/column, not their relative one. It would be possible to create such a select operation which would make CC much cleaner (essentially implemented in plain GraphBLAS).

### Testing

We need to translate the Graph500 test eventually. (Long discussion on testing...)
